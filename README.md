# SOAcial
SOAcial is a website, designed for the students of SOA. 

Not only does it help the students to connect with their friends, alumni and faculties, but also facilitates folks from various institutes of SOA to connect with each other for exchanging information.

Students of SOA University do not have a platform where they can connect with other students and alumni of SOA University . The other social networking websites/apps that already exist allow everyone irrespective of their institute/university to create their profiles. This approach increases complexity and students often find difficulties in finding out people who belong to their institute/university. Moreover, students struggle to connect with alumni of their institute, who can help them regarding many job opportunities.

Students can easily search their peers as per their branch using various filters provided in the website.
